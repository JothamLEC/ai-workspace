# EMAS CIDA

## What is EMAS CIDA?

**EMAS Customer ID Assurance (CIDA)** is a flexible, customizable, and future-proof framework that allows digital businesses to scale their Assurance, Authentication, and Authorization (3A) requirements.

## What EMAS CIDA Aims to Achieve

Many digital businesses today have rapidly expanding 3A requirements:

- **Evolving security needs** - Usernames and passwords are no longer sufficient. Users now need security questions, OTP codes, and more. eKYC systems alone may not meet future demands.
- **Constant innovation by fraudsters** - The 3A space is evolving quickly as fraudsters find new attack vectors.
- **Demand for automation** - Businesses require more automation and digitalization within their processes.
  - Example: Banks need systems that automatically retrieve user credit scores during onboarding, reducing processing time.

In addition to EMAS eKYC, Innov8tif partners with regional providers to help businesses implement this comprehensive framework.
