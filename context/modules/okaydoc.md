# OkayDoc

## What is OkayDoc?

OkayDoc is the **Document Authentication** module of EMAS eKYC. It verifies whether a user-submitted ID document is genuine, legitimate, and authentic.

## How it Works

Most government-issued ID documents contain security features that verify their authenticity, including:
- Holograms
- Ghost images
- Microprints
- Watermarks
- Special fonts
- UV features

OkayDoc uses advanced AI algorithms to check ID documents for these security features. Additionally, OkayDoc has anti-spoofing and anti-tampering capabilities.

## Why it Matters

### The Fraud Problem
Fraudsters constantly find ways to create false documents to conduct criminal activities. Traditional companies relied on:
- Employees manually verifying ID documents
- Guidebooks for authentication
- In-person verification

This is impossible today, where accounts can be registered online without human touchpoints.

### OkayDoc Solution
OkayDoc allows companies to:
- Onboard customers 100% digitally
- Comply with KYC regulations
- Prevent most fraudulent sign-up attempts
- Serve as a deterrent for cybercriminals
