# Video Call Verification

## Overview

Video verification allows companies to verify users remotely instead of requiring users to visit physical branches. This human-assisted verification method provides an additional layer of security and flexibility for customer onboarding.

## How It Works

The process may change depending on business needs, but typical steps include:

1. **User Initiates eKYC**
   - User starts process via official website or mobile app
   - Provides personal information (name, date of birth, address)
   - Submits clear image of government-issued ID

2. **Live Video Session**
   - User participates in live video verification using device camera
   - Smartphone or webcam supported

3. **Human Verifier Guidance**
   - Verifier guides customer through verification steps:
     - Show ID on camera
     - Compare ID photo with live appearance
     - Perform liveness check
     - Answer security questions

4. **Database Cross-Checking**
   - System verifies user information against various databases
   - Final approval or rejection decision made

## Benefits

### Enhanced Security
Video verification makes it difficult for fraudsters to impersonate someone else, as it involves:
- Real-time interaction
- Direct comparison of live appearance with government-issued ID
- Human judgment to detect suspicious behavior

### Leverage Existing Staffing
This method is suitable for companies that have existing customer support teams that can take advantage of video verification systems. No need to hire specialized verification staff.

### Digital Signatures
EMAS CIDA bundles digital signatures with video verification services, further streamlining the user onboarding process.

## Limitations

### Privacy Concerns
Some customers may be hesitant to participate in video verification due to:
- Privacy concerns
- Discomfort with sharing live appearance
- Cultural sensitivities

### Internet Connectivity
Video verification requires stable internet connection, which may not be available for all customers, especially in:
- Remote areas
- Rural locations
- Regions with poor infrastructure

### Technical Issues
Customers may face technical difficulties:
- Poor video quality
- Device compatibility issues
- Audio problems
- Browser limitations

## Best Practices

### Train Staff Effectively
Ensure staff members are trained on:
- Correct eKYC procedures
- Software utilization
- Customer service skills
- Cultural sensitivity
- Handling difficult situations during verification

### Inform Customers
Develop clear communication strategies:
- How to prepare for the call
- What to expect during the call
- How personal information will be handled
- Privacy and security measures

### Ensure Scalability
Build a user verification service that is scalable:
- Implement fully digital eKYC using biometric authentication for low-value transactions
- Reserve video verification for high-risk or high-value cases
- Reduce workload on video verification team
- Improve overall customer experience

## Use Cases

- **High-value account opening** - Additional verification for premium accounts
- **Failed automated verification** - Fallback when [EMAS eKYC](../products/emas-ekyc.md) flags issues
- **Complex cases** - Unusual documents or special circumstances
- **Regulated industries** - Industries requiring human oversight
- **Appeal process** - When users are flagged by automated systems

## Integration with EMAS CIDA
